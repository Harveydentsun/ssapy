This library is intended to replicate Self Confirming Price Prediction from Yoon & Wellman 2011,
"Self-Confirming Price Prediction for Bidding in Simultaneous Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auctions". 

Though originally I thought to make it an object oriented library, I wanted to parallelize the algorithms which 
for cross-platform compatibility necessitated the use of the python multiprocessing module which makes
executable scripts manditory on MS Windows (__main__ must be defined).
