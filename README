This is a public git repository for code I'm developing while a PhD candidate in the department of 
Electrical Engineering at Brown University.

I will keep source code developed for class projects and other random ideas here. 

I am also a developer for the vxl project and anything not related to vxl or 
main thread of research (computer vision) will be stored here.
