The decision of what language to use for projects was left up to students and for no other reason
than that I wanted to become a better python programmer, I decided to implement all code in python.
Beyond the standard libraries, numpy and matlibplot modules are necessary to run the code at this point.
I may want to delv into pyOpenCL at some point but as of yet it is not needed.

The basic structed is that all libraries, class and functions are located in the directory
auctionSimulator.

I use the contents of auctionTests to write scripts utilizing this library to run tests and simulations.
