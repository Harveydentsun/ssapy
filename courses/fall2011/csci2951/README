This directory contains code written for CSCI2951, "Autonomous Agents and Computational Market Design"
with Professor Amy Greenwald, and TA Eric Sodomka in the Computer Science Department at Brown University.

The decision of which language to use was left up to students. I decided to implement my code in python
in order to become a more fluid python programmer.

Beyond the standard libraries, numpy and matlibplot modules are necessary to run the code at this point.
I may want to delve into pyOpenCL at some point, but haven't as of yet.

I recommend downloading external python libraries from Christoph Gohlke at:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

They are the "bees' knees" of python builds.

The basic structure is that all libraries, class and functions are located in the directory
auctionSimulator.

I use the contents of auctionTests to write scripts utilizing this library to implement 
test cases and simulations.
